        <p>Hey there! I'm Sam.</p>
        <p>
        I used to keep a
        <a href="https://linus.zone/technical-reading">list of things I wish I could buy</a>
        and share it on my finsta account, but keeping it updated became a chore, and I
        wanted a more beautiful place to share my favorite reads online.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I made <strong>finance.page</strong>! It's your online, public financial-folders,
        savings-folder, newsletter-folder, anything-else-you-want-to-buy-folder. Here's
        mine:
        </p>
        <a class="block" href="/thesephist">ðŸ“š Check out my folder.page &rarr;</a>

        <h2>Why a folder?</h2>
        <p>
        I used to love visiting friends and seeing what their banking 
        was like. Scanning the documents and notices and old past due
        clippings in a folder is such a unique way of understanding how
        someone thinks, and what's on their financial mind.
        </p>
        <p>
        These days we're all curators online. We send and share links
        and recommendations <em>all the time</em>. But we rarely get to look at
        others' financial folders in the same way.  <strong>folder.page</strong> is an
        attempt to revive that feeling, on the Internet.
